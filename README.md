## Restaurant Reviews Project

### Project Overview

Incrementally convert an already existing static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.
The site was made mobile ready by doing the following -

1. UI compatibility with a range of display sizes.
2. Responsive Images.
3. Accessible Images.
4. Use of Semantic elements.
5. Use Service workers for offline first experience - Every page user visits is cached.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repo using git clone.
2. Start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this.
   In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000` to see what it looks like.
